# Four clear patterns of entries have arisen along with some other minor problems:
#   
# 1. Many students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet did not enter any inches. 
#   For example, 6' - our pattern requires that inches be included.
# 2. Some students measuring exactly 5 or 6 feet entered just that number.
# 3. Some of the inches were entered with decimal points. For example 5'7.5''. 
#   Our pattern only looks for two digits.
# 4. Some entires have spaces at the end, for example 5 ' 9.
# 5. Some entries are in meters and some of these use European decimals: 1.6, 1,7.
# 6. Two students added cm.
# 7. One student spelled out the numbers: Five foot eight inches.
# It is not necessarily clear that it is worth writing code to handle all these
# cases since they might be rare enough. However, some give us an opportunity to
# learn some more regex techniques so we will build a fix.

# Case 1
# For case 1, if we add a '0 to, for example, convert all 6 to 6'0, then our
# pattern will match. This can be done using groups using the following code:
  
yes <- c("5", "6", "5")
no <- c("5'", "5''", "5'4")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([4-7])$", "\\1'0")

# The pattern says it has to start (^), be followed with a digit between 4 and 7,
# and then end there ($). The parenthesis defines the group that we pass as \\1 to
# the replace regex.

# Cases 2 and 4
# We can adapt this code slightly to handle case 2 as well which covers the entry
# 5'. Note that the 5' is left untouched by the code above. This is because the
# extra ' makes the pattern not match since we have to end with a 5 or 6. 
# To handle case 2, we want to permit the 5 or 6 to be followed by no or one symbol
# for feet. So we can simply add '{0,1} after the ' to do this. We can also use
# the none or once special character ?. As we saw previously, this is different
# from * which is none or more. We now see that this code also handles the fourth
# case as well:

str_replace(s, "^([56])'?$", "\\1'0")

# Note that here we only permit 5 and 6 but not 4 and 7. This is because heights
# of exactly 5 and exactly 6 feet tall are quite common, so we assume those that
# typed 5 or 6 really meant either 60 or 72 inches. However, heights of exactly 4
# or exactly 7 feet tall are so rare that, although we accept 84 as a valid entry,
# we assume that a 7 was entered in error.

# Case 3
# We can use quantifiers to deal with  case 3. These entries are not matched
# because the inches include decimals and our pattern does not permit this. 
# We need allow the second group to include decimals and not just digits. 
# This means we must permit zero or one period . followed by zero or more digits. 
# So we will use both ? and *. Also remember that for this particular case, 
# the period needs to be escaped since it is a special character 
# (it means any character except a line break).
# 
# So we can adapt our pattern, currently ^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d{1,2}$, 
# to permit a decimal at the end:

pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*(\\d+\\.?\\d*)$"

# Case 5
# Case 5, meters using commas, we can approach similarly to how we converted the
# x.y to x'y. A difference is that we require that the first digit is 1 or 2:

yes <- c("1,7", "1, 8", "2, " )
no <- c("5,8", "5,3,2", "1.7")
s <- c(yes, no)
str_replace(s, "^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2")

# We will later check if the entries are meters using their numeric values.

# Trimming
# In general, spaces at the start or end of the string are uninformative.
# These can be particularly deceptive because sometimes they can be hard to see:
  
s <- "Hi "
cat(s)
identical(s, "Hi")

# This is a general enough problem that there is a function dedicated to removing
# them: str_trim.

str_trim("5 ' 9 ")

# To upper and to lower case
# One of the entries writes out numbers as words: Five foot eight inches. 
# Although not efficient, we could add 12 extra str_replace to convert zero to 0, 
# one to 1, and so on. To avoid having to write two separate operations for 
# Zero and zero, One and one, etc., we can use the str_to_lower() function to 
# make all words lower case first:

s <- c("Five feet eight inches")
str_to_lower(s)

# Putting it into a function
# We are now ready to define a procedure that handles converting all the
# problematic cases.
# 
# We can now put all this together into a function that takes a string vector
# and tries to convert as many strings as possible to a single format. 
# Below is a function that puts together the previous code replacements:
  
convert_format <- function(s){
    s %>%
      str_replace("feet|foot|ft", "'") %>% #convert feet symbols to '
      str_replace_all("inches|in|''|\"|cm|and", "") %>%  #remove inches and other symbols
      str_replace("^([4-7])\\s*[,\\.\\s+]\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1'\\2") %>% #change x.y, x,y x y
      str_replace("^([56])'?$", "\\1'0") %>% #add 0 when to 5 or 6
      str_replace("^([12])\\s*,\\s*(\\d*)$", "\\1\\.\\2") %>% #change european decimal
      str_trim() #remove extra space
}

# We can also write a function that converts words to numbers:
  
words_to_numbers <- function(s){
    str_to_lower(s) %>%  
      str_replace_all("zero", "0") %>%
      str_replace_all("one", "1") %>%
      str_replace_all("two", "2") %>%
      str_replace_all("three", "3") %>%
      str_replace_all("four", "4") %>%
      str_replace_all("five", "5") %>%
      str_replace_all("six", "6") %>%
      str_replace_all("seven", "7") %>%
      str_replace_all("eight", "8") %>%
      str_replace_all("nine", "9") %>%
      str_replace_all("ten", "10") %>%
      str_replace_all("eleven", "11")
}

# Now we can see which problematic entries remain:
  
converted <- problems %>% words_to_numbers %>% convert_format
remaining_problems <- converted[not_inches_or_cm(converted)]
pattern <- "^[4-7]\\s*'\\s*\\d+\\.?\\d*$"

# Case Study: Extracting a Table from a PDF
# One of the datasets provided in dslabs shows scientific funding rates by gender in the Netherlands:
  
library(dslabs)
data("research_funding_rates")
research_funding_rates 

# The data come from a paper External link published in the prestigious journal
# PNAS. However, the data are not provided in a spreadsheet; they are in a table
# in a PDF document. We could extract the numbers by hand, but this could lead
# to human error. Instead we can try to wrangle the data using R.

# Downloading the data
# We start by downloading the PDF document then importing it into R using the
# following code:
  
library("pdftools")
temp_file <- tempfile()
url <- "https://www.pnas.org/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1073%2Fpnas.1510159112&file=pnas.201510159SI.pdf"
download.file(url, temp_file)
txt <- pdf_text(temp_file)
file.remove(temp_file)

# If we examine the object text we notice that it is a character vector with an
# entry for each page. So we keep the page we want using the following code:
  
raw_data_research_funding_rates <- txt[2]

# The steps above can actually be skipped because we include the raw data in the
# dslabs package as well:
  
data("raw_data_research_funding_rates")

# Looking at the download
# Examining this object,

raw_data_research_funding_rates %>% head

# we see that it is a long string. Each line on the page, including the table 
# rows, is separated by the symbol for newline: \n.

# We can therefore can create a list with the lines of the text as elements:
  
tab <- str_split(raw_data_research_funding_rates, "\n")

# Because we start off with just one element in the string, we end up with a list
# with just one entry:
  
tab <- tab[[1]]

# By examining this object,

tab %>% head

# we see that the information for the column names is the third and fourth entires:
  
the_names_1 <- tab[3]
the_names_2 <- tab[4]

# In the table, the column information is spread across two lines. We want to 
# create one vector with one name for each column. We can do this using some of 
# the functions we have just learned.
# 
# Extracting the table data
# Let's start with the first line:

the_names_1

# We want to remove the leading space and everything following the comma. We can
# use regex for the latter. Then we can obtain the elements by splitting using the
# space. We want to split only when there are 2 or more spaces to avoid splitting 
# success rate. So we use the regex \\s{2,} as follows:

the_names_1 <- the_names_1 %>%
  str_trim() %>%
  str_replace_all(",\\s.", "") %>%
  str_split("\\s{2,}", simplify = TRUE)
the_names_1

# Now let's look at the second line:
  
the_names_2

# Here we want to trim the leading space and then split by space as we did for the
# first line:
  
the_names_2 <- the_names_2 %>%
  str_trim() %>%
  str_split("\\s+", simplify = TRUE)
the_names_2

# Now we can join these to generate one name for each column:
  
tmp_names <- str_c(rep(the_names_1, each = 3), the_names_2[-1], sep = "_")
the_names <- c(the_names_2[1], tmp_names) %>%
  str_to_lower() %>%
  str_replace_all("\\s", "_")
the_names

# Now we are ready to get the actual data. By examining the tab object, we notice
# that the information is in lines 6 through 14. We can use str_split() again to 
# achieve our goal:
  
new_research_funding_rates <- tab[6:14] %>%

# Case study: Trump Tweets
# During the 2016 US presidential election, then-candidate Donald J. Trump used
# his Twitter account as a way to communicate with potential voters. 
# On August 6, 2016 Todd Vaziri tweeted External link about Trump that
# "Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff). Every hyperbolic tweet
# is from Android (from him)." Data scientist David Robinson conducted an analysis
# External link to determine if data supported this assertion. Here we go through
# David's analysis to learn some of the basics of text mining. To learn more about
# text mining in R we recommend this book External link.

# We notice a big peak for the Android in early hours of the morning, between 6 
# and 8 AM. There seems to be a clear different in these patterns. We will 
# therefore assume that two different entities are using these two devices. 
# Now we will study how their tweets differ. To do this we introduce the tidytext
# package.

# Text as data
# The tidytext package helps us convert free from text into a tidy table. Having
# the data in this format greatly facilitates data visualization and applying
# statistical techniques.

library(tidytext)

# The main function needed to achieve this is unnest_tokens(). A token refers to
# the units that we are considering to be a data point. The most common tokens 
# will be words, but they can also be single characters, ngrams, sentences, lines
# or a pattern defined by a regex. The functions will take a vector of strings and
# extract the tokens so that each one gets a row in the new table. Here is a 
# simple example:
  
example <- tibble(line = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
                        text = c("Roses are red,", "Violets are blue,", "Sugar is sweet,", "And so are you."))
example
example %>% unnest_tokens(word, text)

# Now let's look at a quick example with a tweet number 3008:

i <- 3008
campaign_tweets$text[i]
campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  select(word)

# Note that the function tries to convert tokens into words and strips characters
# important to twitter such as # and @. A token in twitter is not the same as in
# regular English. For this reason, instead of using the default token, words, we
# define a regex that captures twitter character. The pattern appears complex but
# all we are defining is a patter that starts with @, # or neither and is followed
# by any combination of letters or digits:

pattern <- "([^A-Za-z\\d#@']|'(?![A-Za-z\\d#@]))"

# We can now use the unnest_tokens() function with the regex option and 
# appropriately extract the hashtags and mentions:
  
campaign_tweets[i,] %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  select(word)

# Now we are ready to extract the words for all our tweets.

tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) 

# And we can now answer questions such as "what are the most commonly used words?"

tweet_words %>% 
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# It is not surprising that these are the top words. The top words are not 
# informative. The tidytext package has database of these commonly used words, 
# referred to as stop words, in text mining:
  
stop_words

# If we filter out rows representing stop words with filter(!word %in% stop_words$word):
  
tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word ) 

# We end up with a much more informative set of top 10 tweeted words:
  
tweet_words %>% 
  count(word) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Some exploration of the resulting words (not show here) reveals a couple of 
# unwanted characteristics in our tokens. First, some of our tokens are just 
# numbers (years for example). We want to remove these and we can find them using
# the regex ^\d+$. Second, some of our tokens come from a quote and they start 
# with '. We want to remove the ' when it's at the start of a word, so we will use 
# str_replace(). We add these two lines to the code above to generate our final
# table:

tweet_words <- campaign_tweets %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "https://t.co/[A-Za-z\\d]+|&amp;", ""))  %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "regex", pattern = pattern) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word &
           !str_detect(word, "^\\d+$")) %>%
  mutate(word = str_replace(word, "^'", ""))

# Now that we have all our words in a table, along with information about what 
# device was used to compose the tweet they came from, we can start exploring 
# which words are more common when comparing Android to iPhone.
# 
# For each word we want to know if it is more likely to come from an Android tweet
# or an iPhone tweet. We previously introduced the odds ratio, a summary statistic
# useful for quantifying these differences. For each device and a given word, 
# let's call it y, we compute the odds or the ratio between the proportion of words
# that are y and not y and compute the ratio of those odds. Here we will have many
# proportions that are 0 so we use the 0.5 correction.

android_iphone_or <- tweet_words %>%
  count(word, source) %>%
  spread(source, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(or = (Android + 0.5) / (sum(Android) - Android + 0.5) / 
           ( (iPhone + 0.5) / (sum(iPhone) - iPhone + 0.5)))
android_iphone_or %>% arrange(desc(or))
android_iphone_or %>% arrange(or)

# Given that several of these words are overall low frequency words we can impose
# a filter based on the total frequency like this:
  
android_iphone_or %>% filter(Android+iPhone > 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(or))

android_iphone_or %>% filter(Android+iPhone > 100) %>%
  arrange(or)

# We already see somewhat of a pattern in the types of words that are being 
# tweeted more in one device versus the other. However, we are not interested in
# specific words but rather in the tone. Vaziri's assertion is that the Android 
# tweets are more hyperbolic. So how can we check this with data? 
# Hyperbolic is a hard sentiment to extract from words as it relies on 
# interpreting phrases. However, words can be associated to more basic sentiment 
# such as as anger, fear, joy and surprise. In the next section we demonstrate 
# basic sentiment analysis.
# 
# Sentiment Analysis
# In sentiment analysis we assign a word to one or more "sentiment". Although this
# approach will miss context dependent sentiments, such as sarcasm, when performed 
# on large numbers of words, summaries can provide insights.
# 
# The first step in sentiment analysis is to assign a sentiment to each word. The
# tidytext package includes several maps or lexicons in the object sentiments:

sentiments 

# There are several lexicons in the tidytext package that give different 
# sentiments. For example, the bing lexicon divides words into positive and 
# negative. We can see this using the tidytext function get_sentiments():
  
get_sentiments("bing")

# The AFINN lexicon assigns a score between -5 and 5, with -5 the most negative 
# and 5 the most positive.
library(textdata)
get_sentiments("afinn")

# The loughran and nrc lexicons provide several different sentiments:
  
get_sentiments("loughran") %>% count(sentiment)
get_sentiments("nrc") %>% count(sentiment)
1

# To start learning about how these lexicons were developed, read this help file:
#   ?sentiments.
# 
# For the analysis here we are interested in exploring the different sentiments of
# each tweet, so we will use the nrc lexicon:
  
nrc <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>%
  select(word, sentiment)
1
# We can combine the words and sentiments using inner_join(), which will only keep
# words associated with a sentiment. Here are 10 random words extracted from the
# tweets:
  
tweet_words %>% inner_join(nrc, by = "word") %>% 
  select(source, word, sentiment) %>% sample_n(10)

# Now we are ready to perform a quantitative analysis comparing Android and iPhone
# by comparing the sentiments of the tweets posted from each device. Here we could
# perform a tweet by tweet analysis, assigning a sentiment to each tweet. However, 
# this somewhat complex since each tweet will have several sentiments attached to
# it, one for each word appearing in the lexicon. For illustrative purposes, we 
# will perform a much simpler analysis: we will count and compare the frequencies 
# of each sentiment appears for each device.

sentiment_counts <- tweet_words %>%
  left_join(nrc, by = "word") %>%
  count(source, sentiment) %>%
  spread(source, n) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = replace_na(sentiment, replace = "none"))
sentiment_counts

# Because more words were used on the Android than on the phone:
  
tweet_words %>% group_by(source) %>% summarize(n = n())

# for each sentiment we can compute the odds of being in the device: proportion of
# words with sentiment versus proportion of words without and then compute the
# odds ratio comparing the two devices:

sentiment_counts %>%
  mutate(Android = Android / (sum(Android) - Android) , 
         iPhone = iPhone / (sum(iPhone) - iPhone), 
         or = Android/iPhone) %>%
  arrange(desc(or))

# So we do see some difference and the order is interesting: the largest three 
# sentiments are disgust, anger, and negative! But are they statistically 
# significant? How does this compare if we are just assigning sentiments at random?
#   
# To answer that question we can compute, for each sentiment, an odds ratio and 
# confidence interval. We will add the two values we need to form a two-by-two 
# table and the odds ratio:
  
library(broom)
log_or <- sentiment_counts %>%
  mutate( log_or = log( (Android / (sum(Android) - Android)) / (iPhone / (sum(iPhone) - iPhone))),
          se = sqrt( 1/Android + 1/(sum(Android) - Android) + 1/iPhone + 1/(sum(iPhone) - iPhone)),
          conf.low = log_or - qnorm(0.975)*se,
          conf.high = log_or + qnorm(0.975)*se) %>%
  arrange(desc(log_or))

log_or

# A graphical visualization shows some sentiments that are clearly overrepresented:
  
log_or %>%
  mutate(sentiment = reorder(sentiment, log_or),) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sentiment, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  geom_errorbar() +
  geom_point(aes(sentiment, log_or)) +
  ylab("Log odds ratio for association between Android and sentiment") +
  coord_flip() 

# We see that the disgust, anger, negative sadness and fear sentiments are 
# associated with the Android in a way that is hard to explain by chance alone. 
# Words not associated to a sentiment were strongly associated with the iPhone
# source, which is in agreement with the original claim about hyperbolic tweets.
# 
# If we are interested in exploring which specific words are driving these 
# differences, we can back to our android_iphone_or object:
  
android_iphone_or %>% inner_join(nrc) %>%
  filter(sentiment == "disgust" & Android + iPhone > 10) %>%
  arrange(desc(or))

# We can make a graph:
  
android_iphone_or %>% inner_join(nrc, by = "word") %>%
  mutate(sentiment = factor(sentiment, levels = log_or$sentiment)) %>%
  mutate(log_or = log(or)) %>%
  filter(Android + iPhone > 10 & abs(log_or)>1) %>%
